# Smart-A.I-With-3d-visuals
I am making a project which talk with us like human it gives 3d visuals and interact with us using camera and also give detail about things using pictures it have great data storage.

## Plan

I want to make a project which talk with us like human using **A.i** **esp32** tak input from **Microphone**, also give 3d visuals using **screen** **hologram** ,  recognise our face and give responses using **Camera** **esp32**, and also if we want detail of image it will give use **Microsdcard** for storage it will get power by battery.
